            <h1>Equality in Genders</h1>
            <p>Gender equality is intrinsically linked to sustainable development and is vital to the realization of
                human
                rights for
                all. The overall objective of gender equality is a society in which women and men enjoy the same
                opportunities, rights
                and obligations in all spheres of life.</p>
