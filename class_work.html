    <p class="main_para"> The <b>2024 US presidential election</b> is dominating headlines as candidates from both major
        parties ramp up
        their
        campaigns.
        President Joe Biden, seeking re-election, faces challenges from within his own Democratic Party as well as a
        strong
        Republican field. Key issues such as the economy, healthcare, and foreign policy are at the forefront of the
        debates.
        The Republican primary is particularly competitive, with several high-profile candidates, including former
        President
        Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, vying for the nomination. </p>
